# Shumai Recipe
## Ingredients
### For the Filling:
- ½ lb ground pork
- ½ lb shrimp, chopped
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp white pepper
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2 tbsp chopped scallions
- 2 tbsp chopped shiitake mushrooms (optional)
### For the Dumplings:
- 25–30 round wonton wrappers
- 1 carrot, grated (for garnish)
- Peas (optional, for garnish)
## Directions
1. Mix the pork, shrimp, soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, salt, white pepper, and cornstarch in a bowl until well combined.
2. Stir in the chopped scallions and mushrooms, then mix until the filling turns slightly sticky.
3. Place a wonton wrapper in your palm and spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling into the center.
4. Gather the edges of the wrapper around the filling, pressing gently to form a small open-top dumpling.
5. Lightly press some grated carrot or a pea onto the top of each dumpling for garnish.
6. Line a steamer with parchment paper or cabbage leaves to prevent sticking.
7. Arrange the shumai in the steamer, making sure they don’t touch each other.
8. Steam over boiling water for 8–10 minutes, or until the filling is fully cooked.
9. Remove from the steamer and serve hot with soy sauce, chili oil, or black vinegar.

Enjoy!
