# Lungs
#### YOHA (Graham Harwood and Matsuko Yokokoji) 2005
- I found *Lungs* by YOHA most resonating to me. This particular project, rather than creating a virtual space or constructing online connections between people, attempts to recreate history, connecting people to the past by simulating the functioning of the lungs of the slave workers under Nazi during WWII. 
- Not only is the respiratory process simulated a projection of the existence of those once lived people, but the well designed amount of air blew from the machine estimated through calculations allows us to approach that subtle yet significant part of history in one of the most direct and touching ways.
