## Debug Together!

We are going to debug an HTML and CSS file.

The site is supposed to look like the following image:

![Right Image](/Week6/Week6_Feb27th/DebugTogether/FixedCodeImage.png)

Instead it currently looks like this:
![Broken Image](/Week6/Week6_Feb27th/DebugTogether/BrokenCodeImage.png)

Spend 10 minutes debugging and then as a class we can debug together.
